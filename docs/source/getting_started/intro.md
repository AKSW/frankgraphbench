# Introduction

This project is an outcome of [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/3NTZTLYb)
project at DBpedia, named Knowledge Graph aware Recommender Systems with DBpedia.

This project has two main components:

- **Data Integration**: for enriching standard Recommender Systems datasets using DBpedia.
- **Framework**: for running reproducible experiments on enriched and non-enriched datasets through a `.yml`  configuration file.

As part of the Data Integration module we fixed and used the DBpedia 2016-10 core version, accessible through the endpoint () and with .ttl files downloadable  here ().
