0,"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgård, James Spader, and Samuel L. Jackson. In Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Avengers fight Ultron, an artificial intelligence obsessed with causing human extinction. The sequel was announced in May 2012, after the successful release of The Avengers. Whedon, the director of the first film, was brought back on board in August and a release date was set. By April 2013, Whedon had completed a draft of the script, and casting began in June with the re-signing of Downey. Second unit filming began in February 2014 in South Africa with principal photography taking place between March and August 2014. The film was primarily shot at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, with additional footage filmed in Italy, South Korea, Bangladesh, New York, and various locations around England. While in post production, the film was converted to 3D and over 3,000 visual effects shots were added. Avengers: Age of Ultron premiered in Los Angeles on April 13, 2015, and was released on May 1, 2015 in North America, in 3D and IMAX 3D. The film received positive reviews from critics, most of whom enjoyed its action sequences and villain, judging them to be extravagant but unmemorable. It grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film in history and the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2015. A sequel, Avengers: Infinity War, is scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, and another untitled sequel is scheduled for May 3, 2019.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Feige,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joss_Whedon,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Davis_(cinematographer),http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_action_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_adventure_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_science_fiction_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2015_3D_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_science_fiction_action_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_sequel_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Android_(robot)_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Avengers_(comics)_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Crossover_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dolby_Atmos_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drone_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:English-language_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Film_scores_by_Brian_Tyler::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Film_scores_by_Danny_Elfman::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_about_artificial_intelligence::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_directed_by_Joss_Whedon::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_London::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_New_York_City::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Norway::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Seoul::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_South_Africa::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_a_fictional_European_country::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Aosta_Valley::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Chittagong_Division::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Gyeonggi_Province::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Hampshire::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Kent::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_London::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_New_York::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Norfolk::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Seoul::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_South_Africa::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_using_computer-generated_imagery::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:IMAX_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Impact_event_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mind_control_in_fiction::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Performance_capture_in_film::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Robot_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Science_fiction_adventure_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Screenplays_by_Joss_Whedon::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Shepperton_Studios_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Telekinesis_in_film,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Taylor-Johnson::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Mackie::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Evans_(actor)::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Hemsworth::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cobie_Smulders::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Cheadle::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_Olsen::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hayley_Atwell::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Idris_Elba::http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Spader::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_Renner::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Ruffalo::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Bettany::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Downey_Jr.::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_L._Jackson::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scarlett_Johansson::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stellan_Skarsgård,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joss_Whedon

2,"Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast, including Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions—one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Development of Civil War began in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline Civil War, while also focusing on story and character elements from the previous Captain America films to conclude the trilogy. Following positive reactions to test screenings of The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014. The film's title and premise were revealed in October 2014, along with Downey's casting; additional cast members joined in the following months. Principal photography began in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in the Metro Atlanta area before concluding in Germany in August 2015, with the film being the first to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras (for the film's central ""splash panel""-inspired fight sequence). Visual effects were provided by nearly 20 different studios during the post-production process. Captain America: Civil War held its world premiere in Los Angeles on April 12, 2016, and was released in the United States on May 6, 2016, in 3D and IMAX 3D. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2016 and the 12th highest-grossing film of all time.",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Feige,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Markus_and_Stephen_McFeely,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trent_Opaloch,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_action_thriller_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_adventure_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_psychological_thriller_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2010s_science_fiction_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:2016_3D_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_3D_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_action_thriller_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_political_thriller_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_psychological_thriller_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_science_fiction_action_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_science_fiction_thriller_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:American_sequel_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Babelsberg_Studio_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Captain_America_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Crossover_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Dolby_Atmos_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Drone_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Film_scores_by_Henry_Jackman::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_about_revenge::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_about_terrorism::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_based_on_works_by_Mark_Millar::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_directed_by_Anthony_and_Joe_Russo::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_1991::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_2016::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Berlin::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Bucharest::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Cleveland::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Germany::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Lagos::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_London::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Massachusetts::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_New_York::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Queens,_New_York::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Siberia::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_Vienna::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_a_fictional_African_country::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_prison::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_set_in_the_Atlantic_Ocean::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_at_Pinewood_Atlanta_Studios::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Atlanta::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Berlin::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Brazil::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Germany::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Norway::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_Puerto_Rico::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Films_shot_in_multiple_formats::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:IMAX_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Mind_control_in_fiction::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Science_fiction_adventure_films::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Screenplays_by_Christopher_Markus_&_Stephen_McFeely::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Size_change_in_fiction::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Superhero_films",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Mackie::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chadwick_Boseman::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Evans_(actor)::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Brühl::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Cheadle::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_Olsen::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emily_VanCamp::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Grillo::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_Renner::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Bettany::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Rudd::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Downey_Jr.::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scarlett_Johansson::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sebastian_Stan::http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Holland_(actor)::http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Hurt,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russo_brothers
